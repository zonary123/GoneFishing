# Gone Fishing #

## About ##
This mod adds fishing to Hytale, while currently the mod is fairly bare bones. 
Once the game releases and more documentation comes out we will add more things to the mod like new fish, a fishing minigame and more rods.

In the current state of the mod you can craft the fishing rod with 2 Sticks and 3 Linen Scraps in a Workbench. 
To use the fishing rod just equip it and right-click while looking at water to launch a bobber into the water. 
The bobber will be dragged underwater when a fish can be caught and reeled in by right-clicking the fishing rod again. 
Currently, you can catch any fish in the base game.
